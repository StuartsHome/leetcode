## Introduction
Asymptotic
The letter `O` is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function. 
A description of a function in terms of big `O` notation usually only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function.

- Omega is bounded below
- Theta is bounded above and below
- Big O is bound above

## Time Complexity
- Binary Search - O(log n)
- Sort - O(n log n)
- Dijkstra - O(v + e log n)
