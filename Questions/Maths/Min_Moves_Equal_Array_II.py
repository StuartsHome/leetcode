# Leetcode 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
# Find the median:
# - we can effectively reduce the problem size from n to n-2 by discarding min and max points.
#   Do you see it? That is the definition of median, isn't it?
# Not mean because:
# - mean is where
# sum of distances to smaller elements = sum of distances to larger elements.
# So net number of moves
# = 2 * (either sum of distances to lower or larger elements)

# Use sorted instead of sort:
# 1. sorted returns a sorted list and can be used on any iterable
#Â 2. sort modifies the list in place, and returns None. It's usually less convenient than sorted()

class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums):
        N = sorted(nums)
        mid = len(nums) //2
        val = N[mid]
        count = 0
        for num in N:
            count += abs(num - val)
        return int(count)


Run = Solution()
Run.minMoves2([1,2,3])
