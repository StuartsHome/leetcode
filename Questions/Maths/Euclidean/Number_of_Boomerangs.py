# Leetcode 447. Number of Boomerangs.
# At each point i, create a hashmap memo of the form {d:n}
# where n is the total number of points that are d distance from p
# Then we only need to count the number of unique pairs of those points.
# The key insight here is that if we have a list of n points [p1, p2, p3, ..., pn]
# then there are nP2 = (n! / (n-2)!) = n*(n-1) pairs of points that can follow p in order to form a boomerang.

# For every point, there are k points with distance d, so there are k*(k-1) pairwise with distance d.
#Â Permutation formula, to pick 2 out of k elements, the number of combinations is:
# A_(k)^(m=2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-m+1) = k(k-2+1) = k(k-1)
# Which is:
"""
# Sum the total number of combinations for point
for count in distance_count.values():
    result += count * (count - 1)
"""

# Euclidean distance
# Using the Pythagorean theorem to compute two-dimensional Euclidean distance
# d(p,q)**2 = (q1 - p1)**2 + (q2-p2)**2
# Basically you have two points and your calculating the third

# My notes:
"""
n*(n-1) is displayed in two different ways in the solutions below:
1. 
This solution is not adding to count when the distanced is stored in memo first.
But subsequently adds a[c] to count every time it is then found
c = (i[0]-j[0])**2+(i[1]-j[1])**2 
if c not in a:
    a[c]=1
else:
    count += a[c]  
    a[c]+=1
