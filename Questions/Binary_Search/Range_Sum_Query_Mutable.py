# Leetcode 307. Range Sum Query - Mutable

# Solutions:
# 1. Naive - Brute Force: TLE
    # 1. Time Complexity is:
        # Range Sum - O(n)
        # Update    - O(1)        
# 2. Sqrt Decomposition - T: O(n), S: O(sqrt(n))
    # 1. Time complexity is:
        # Preprocessing     - O(n)
        # Range Sum Query   - O(sqrt(n))
        # Update            - O(1)
    # Space Complexity:
        # We need additional sqrt(n) memory to store all block sums.
# 3. Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)
    # Time Complexity:
        # Preprocessing     - O(n log n)  - n elements and for every element takes log n to update itself and nodes to right
        # Range Sum Query   - O(log n)  - The time taken will be the height of the Binary Indexed Tree, which at worst case will be O(log(n))
        # Update            - O(log n)
    # Space:
        # O(n)

# Sqrt decompostion
# 1. Split the array into blocks w/ length of sqrt(n)
# 2. Calculate sunm of each block and store it in auxiliary memory 
# 3. To query RSQ(i, j), we will add the sums of all blocks lying inside
# and those that partially overlap with range [i... j]

"""
- The representation is a BT of nodes, rather than array of buckets.
- An array of buckets will require a O(n) lookup to gather the value
because we have to recompute the total in the buckets by summing up the 
values in all smaller buckets.
- BT of nodes reduces this to (log n), by precomputing the total sum
of all elements before specific points in the sequence.
- Each node in the BT contains the cumulative sum of all the nodes
to the left of that given node.
             4
          /     \
         2       6
        / \     / \
       1   3   5   7

Now, we can augment each node by storing the cumulative sum of all the values including that node and its left subtree. 
Before:
[ +5] [ +1] [+15] [+11] [+52] [+28] [ +0]
  1     2     3     4     5     6     7

After:
                 4
               [+32]
              /     \
           2           6
         [ +6]       [+80]
         /   \       /   \
        1     3     5     7
      [ +5] [+15] [+52] [ +0]

One way that we can think about improving this operation would be to change what we store in the buckets.
Rather than storing the cumulative frequency up to the given point, you can instead think of just storing
the amount that the current frequency has increased relative to the previous bucket. 

# Implementation
# 1. Length of tree will be len(n) + 1, because "0" (the root node) is a dummy node
# 2. For every binary number, find the very last 1 in the number, then drop that bit off, along w/all the bits
# that come after it.
#Â 3. "0" = Left
# 4. "1" = Right
# 5. Lookup and update operations depend on the access path from the node back up to the root.
# 6. Lookup - only care about the right links we follow
#    Upate - only care about the left links we follow

# To compute the cumulative sum up to a node:
# 1. Write out node n in binary
# 2. Set the counter to 0
# 3. Repeat the following while n != 0
    # 1. Add in the value at node n
    # 2. Clear the rightmost 1 bit from n

# 1. Follow path back-up to root.
# 2. Update all nodes where we followed a left link upward:
    # 1. Write out node n in binary
    # 2. Set the counter to 0
    # 3. Repeat the following while n != 0
    # 4. Add in the value at node n
    # 5. Clear the rightmost 0 bit from n
