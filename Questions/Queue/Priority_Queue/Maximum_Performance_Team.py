# Leetcode 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team

# Priority Queue, greedy algorithm
# Greedy because we decompose a problem into a series of stages, and
# at each stage we make the locally optimal choice.

# Solution is derived from an enumeration process.
# At each step we build a locally optimal team by starting from a fixed engineer
# with the minimum efficiency on the team.
# At the end of the enumeration process, we select the maximum among the locally optimal
# solutions to obtain the globally optimal solution.

# The most complex step is the second step. 
# In the second step we have selected a member who will have the lowest
# efficieny in the team. Then we must determine how to construct the rest of the team.
# We must find all eligible candidates whose efficiencies are higher that the fixed member's efficiency
# Sorting the candidates in descending order based on efficiency
# We then iterate through the sorted candidates. For each candidate, we only
# need to consider the earlier candidates. Since the list is sorted, only
# the earlier candidates will have a higher efficiency than the current candidate.

# T: O(n (log n + log k))
# S: O(n + k) - n is size of candidates, k is capacity of queue

# 1. Build list of candidates from inputs, O(n)
# 2. Sort candidates, O(n log n)
#Â 3. Iterate through sorted candidates. At each iteration, we will perform at most two operations
# on the priority queue: one push and one pop.
# Each operation takes: O(log(k - 1)) time, where k - 1 is the capacity of the queue.
# The time complexity of this iteration will be: O(n log k)
