- interviewers are looking for your understanding of the nuances of complex problems and your ability to transform the requirements into comprehensible Classes.

- To simplify things, you can take the following approach for any OOD question you encounter:
1. Clarify the requirements
2. Hash out the primary use cases:
    1. Think about, and then talk through, use cases. Make sure you understand all the different functionality your system is expected to have.
3. Identify key Objects
    1. Now, identify all the objects that will play a role in your solution. For example, if you’re designing a parking lot, these will be things like vehicles, parking spots, parking garages, entrances, exits, garage operators, etc.
4. Identify Operations supported by Objects
    1. For example, a car should be able to move, park in a given spot, and hold a license plate. A parking spot should be able to accommodate a two-wheeled vehicle or a four-wheeled vehicle — and so on.
5. Identify Interactions between Objects
    1. Map out the relationships between the different objects that will need to interface with each other. This is where it all comes together. For example, a car should be able to park in a parking spot. Parking garages should be able to fit multiple parking spots, and so on.


## Questions
- Design Amazon / Flipkart (an online shopping platform)
    1. Beyond the basic functionality (signup, login etc.), interviewers will be looking for the following:
    2. Discoverability: How will the buyer discover a product? How will the search surface results?
    3. Cart & Checkout: Users expect the cart and checkout to behave in a certain way. How will the design adhere to such known best practices while also introducing innovative checkout semantics like One-Click-Purchase?
    4. Payment Methods: Users can pay using credit cards, gift cards, etc. How will the payment method work with the checkout process?
    5. Product Reviews & Ratings: When can a user post a review and a rating? How are useful reviews tracked and less useful reviews de-prioritized?
